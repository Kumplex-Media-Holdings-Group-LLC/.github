## Breakdown of Directories and Files:

1. /kmhgllc-site/:
This is the root directory of 
our project.


2. /assets/:
Contains static assets like images, 
fonts, or icons that are directly 
used in the site.


3. /dist/:
Contains the compiled Tailwind CSS output 
(after running the build process). It can include any other minified or production-ready files for the site.


4. /src/:
Contains the source files for Tailwind CSS (tailwind.css), 
JavaScript (script.js), and other source assets like images 
that you will process or optimize before deploying.


5. /styles/:
If you have custom styles that are not part of Tailwind (for example, custom utility classes or overrides), place them here.


6. /components/:
If you're using a component-based structure, this directory can store reusable parts of your site like the header, footer, or other widgets.


7. index.html:
This is the entry point of your site (home page). It links to the compiled Tailwind CSS, JavaScript, and any assets you use.


8. .gitignore:
This file ensures that files like node_modules, temporary files, and build output don't get committed to GitHub.


9. package.json:
If you are using npm for dependency management, this file contains the list of dependencies (including Tailwind, PostCSS, etc.) and scripts for building your site.


10. postcss.config.js:
Configures PostCSS (if using Tailwind CSS via PostCSS).


11. tailwind.config.js:
Tailwind CSS configuration file, where define are oue custom settings like colors, 
breakpoints, and themes.
